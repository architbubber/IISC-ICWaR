This web-portal is in a developing stage, and once it becomes operational, it is expected to provide an interactive interface for the urban climate change modelling community. In addition to the provisioning of downscaled information for an urban setup, this web-portal will also serve as an information-sharing platform for cutting edge research on climate downscaling.

    'details': '(a) Boundary conditions given for the simulation (b) Velocity along the channel at the after 1000 secondsIn fluid dynamics, there are two fundamental approaches to study problems involving fluid flow. First is the experimental study which typically involves construction of scaled models and second is the theoretical study that involves obtaining solutions from differential equations that govern the fluid flow, either analytically or computationally.  The governing equations that define a flow problem are in differential form and known as Navier-Stokes equations. The art of developing and solving these equations to obtain approximate numerical solutions is called computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Modern studies apply both experimental and CFD analysis and the two complement each other. As part of the Urban Flood Model project, one of the low impact development applications, i.e. porous concrete is being tested to use flood water as a resource, experimentally as well computationally. The simulations for flow through the compound channel which has a smaller section comprising of porous concrete are being carried out using commercially available CFD code of FLOW-3D. Further, flow through an entire channel of porous concrete will be analyzed for estimating the seepage of flood water through it. ',
